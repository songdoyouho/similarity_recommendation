## Setting up the embedding generator model
Our Siamese Network will generate embeddings for each of the images of the
triplet. To do this, we will use a ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet and
connect a few `Dense` layers to it so we can learn to separate these
embeddings.
We will freeze the weights of all the layers of the model up until the layer `conv5_block1_out`.
This is important to avoid affecting the weights that the model has already learned.
We are going to leave the bottom few layers trainable, so that we can fine-tune their weights
during training.
